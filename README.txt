INTRODUCTION
------------
If you just want to get the latest version of this mod to try it out, you can download the zip file from GitHub:

    https://github.com/downloads/theoxylo/minecraft_mod_thx/mod_thx_helicopter_beta_1.6.5_v004.zip

Just copy the zip file to your '%APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods' directory and start Minecraft normally (ModLoader v4 required).

After running at least once, check out the options in file '%APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods\mod_thx.options' for controls and other settings.


DEVELOPMENT
-----------
Welcome to the Minecraft mod_thx Helicopter project! If you are still reading then we will assume you are a modder or would like to become one. Here's what you need to develop, build, test, and play:

1. Minecraft (full version, beta 1.6.5): http://www.minecraft.net

2. ModLoader (v6 for beta 1.6.5): http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=80246#p1223009

3. MCP (version 3.3 for beta 1.6.5): http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/Main_Page

4. Mod_thx source code and project files: git://github.com/theoxylo/minecraft_mod_thx.git

5. Java 6 SDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u25-download-346242.html

6. An IDE or good text editor. Eclipse is recommended: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------
Special thanks to the ModLoader and MCP projects, without which this project would not be possible! And of course, thanks to Notch and the Mojang team for the pure goodness that is Minecraft.
