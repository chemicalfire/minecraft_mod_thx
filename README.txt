INTRODUCTION
------------
If you just want to get the latest version of this mod to try it out, you can download the zip file from GitHub:

    https://github.com/downloads/theoxylo/minecraft_mod_thx/mod_thx_helicopter_beta_1.5_01_v003.zip

Just copy the zip file to your '%APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods' directory and start Minecraft normally (ModLoader v4 required).

After running at least once, check out the options in file '%APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods\mod_thx.options' for controls and other settings.

2. ModLoader (version 1.5_01v4): http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=80246#p1223009

3. MCP (version 3.1): http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/Main_Page

4. Mod_thx source code and project files: git://github.com/theoxylo/minecraft_mod_thx.git

5. Java 6 SDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u25-download-346242.html

6. An IDE or good text editor. Eclipse is recommended: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads
